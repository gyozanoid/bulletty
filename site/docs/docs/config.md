```

These settings reside at the top level.

### `datapath`
**Required**. Set the directory for storing the Library. Accepts the path as a string.

### `tui_auto_update`
Update the library on launch of the TUI. Accepts a boolean. Defaults to `true`.

## 🪝 Hooks
Hooks are set in the `[hooks]` table and allow you to specify shell commands to run at key lifecycle points. See [Hooks](../hooks/) for specific details.

## 🥫 Example config.toml
```toml
datapath = "~/.local/share/bulletty" # Specify the directory for storing the Library
tui_auto_update = true               # Fetch new content on TUI launch
